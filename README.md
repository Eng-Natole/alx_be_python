# Python Basic Arithmetic and Financial Calculations

This repository contains a collection of simple Python scripts that demonstrate basic arithmetic operations, financial calculations, and unit conversions. These scripts were developed as part of my learning journey with ALX Ethiopia.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. Basic Arithmetic Operations (`arithmetic_operations.py`)
- Performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication on two numbers (10 and 5)
- Demonstrates fundamental arithmetic operations in Python
- Includes formatted print statements to display results

### 2. Monthly Savings Calculator (`savings_calculator.py`)
- Takes user input for monthly income and expenses
- Calculates monthly savings (income - expenses)
- Projects annual savings with 5% interest
- Demonstrates user input, basic financial calculations, and formatted output

### 3. Future Age Calculator (`age_calculator.py`)
- Takes user's current age as input
- Calculates and displays what their age will be in 2050 (27 years from 2023)
- Shows simple date-based calculations

### 4. Time Conversion (`time_conversion.py`)
- Converts hours to seconds (2 hours in this example)
- Demonstrates unit conversion calculations
- Shows simple multiplication operation

### 5. Rectangle Area Calculator (`rectangle_area.py`)
- Calculates the area of a rectangle with given length (10) and width (5)
- Demonstrates basic geometric calculations
- Uses multiplication of dimensions

### 6. Simple Interest Calculator (`simple_interest.py`)
- Calculates simple interest on a principal amount (1000)
- Uses given rate (5%) and time period (3 years)
- Demonstrates financial calculation formula implementation

## How to Run

Each script can be run independently using Python 3:

```bash
python3 script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the actual filename you want to run.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- No additional libraries required

## Purpose

These scripts were created to:
- Practice basic Python syntax
- Demonstrate fundamental programming concepts
- Show practical applications of simple calculations
- Prepare for more complex programming challenges in ALX Ethiopia curriculum

## Author

Developed as part of ALX Ethiopia's training program.
