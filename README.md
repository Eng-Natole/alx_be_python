Python Basics: Arithmetic, Finance & Unit Conversion
This repository showcases beginner-friendly Python scripts focused on arithmetic operations, financial calculations, and unit conversions. Developed as part of the ALX Ethiopia learning journey.

üìÇ Project Structure
Script	Description
arithmetic_operations.py	Performs basic addition, subtraction, and multiplication on two numbers (10 and 5). Demonstrates fundamental math operations in Python.
savings_calculator.py	Accepts user input for monthly income and expenses, calculates monthly savings, and projects annual savings with 5% interest.
age_calculator.py	Takes the user's current age and calculates what it will be in 2050. Great for simple date-based logic.
time_conversion.py	Converts 2 hours to seconds. A basic unit conversion script showcasing multiplication.
rectangle_area.py	Calculates the area of a rectangle (length 10, width 5). Demonstrates geometric formula implementation.
simple_interest.py	Computes Simple Interest on a principal of 1000 at 5% rate over 3 years. Applies the formula: SI = (P √ó R √ó T) / 100.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Scripts
Ensure Python 3 is installed, then run any script like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with the desired filename (e.g., savings_calculator.py).

‚úÖ Requirements
Python 3.x

No external libraries required

üéØ Purpose
These mini-projects were built to:
